As stipulated by the franchise agreement, our "Type A - Profile 1" location must contain a minimum of 6,000 customers within a four block radius (or five minute walk time). The pedestrian traffic must be adequate and the lunch habits of the customers must be conducive to eating out.  ?</> ?</> Another key to success lies with our ability to execute our plan.
